I study the interaction of sediment between coastal ecosystems, primarily focuses on the coral reefs of the Florida Keys Reef Tract. Using lipid composition and compound specific isotope analysis I track the biogeochemical cycling of particulate matter. 

As an undergraduate at Northern Arizona University I studied unregulated water sources on the Navajo Nation. I have since transitioned to another oligotrophic system: coral reefs. I have also worked at Mote Marine Laboratories aiding in a project looking at the interactions between sargassum and staghorn coral under the effects of ocean acidification.

# A dynamic energy budget for coral-_Symbiodinium_ symbiosis with particulate matter input
Stony coral are known to ingest particulate matter and assimilate carbon and nitrogen. I put together a dynamic energy budget for coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis which takes particulate matter into account as a nutrient source and the influence of particulate matter reducing light availability.
