##Who I am
Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) studying environmental chemistry focusing on marine biogeochemistry under Dr. Mark Teece. I expect to graduate with my PhD in Spring 2023. I hold a BS in chemistry and a BS in environmental science from Northern Arizona University.

I enjoy teaching and outreach as a teaching assistant at SUNY-ESF and as an adjunct faculty at Onondaga Community College. I serve on SUNY-ESF's Committee on Research and as the Graduate Student Association's Vice President of Research where I am able to speak directly with administration and faculty to improve the conditions of graduate students.
​ 
I study the biogeochemistry of sediment in coastal systems, primarily focusing on the Florida Keys Reef Tract. I use lipid biomarkers, along with stable isotope chemistry to track the origin of settling particles and surface sediment in reefs and another coastal ecosystems. I am also starting to work on the changes in lipid composition regarding stony coral tissue loss disease. In the future I am interested in building on my knowledge of lipids and stable isotopes to study coastal systems and the deep sea.

​In my free time I enjoy exploring with my dog Flynn, reading, fishing, diving, cross stitching and drinking tea. Flynn is working on getting certified as a therapy dog after getting certified as a canine good citizen.
