## Who I am

Hello! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Trinity College in Hartford, CT. In Spring 2023 I earned a PhD in Environmental Chemistry focusing on marine biogeochemistry under Dr. Mark Teece at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF). I hold a BS in chemistry and a BS in environmental science from Northern Arizona University.

As a first generation college student I know the struggle to belong in the classroom and not having the confidence to raise my hand. Through teaching at Trinity College, SUNY ESF, and Onondaga Community College I work to encourage students to ask silly questions. Whether a student is struggling to understand or wants to go deeper into the material, there is always a place for questions in my classroom or office.

I study the biogeochemistry of sediment in coastal systems, primarily focusing on the Florida Keys Reef Tract. I use lipid biomarkers, along with stable isotope chemistry to track the origin of settling particles and surface sediment in reefs and another coastal ecosystems. In the future I am interested in building on my knowledge of lipids and stable isotopes to study coastal systems and the deep sea.

In my free time I enjoy exploring with my dog Flynn, reading, fishing, diving, cross stitching and drinking tea. Flynn is working on getting certified as a therapy dog after getting certified as a canine good citizen
