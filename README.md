Hello! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Trinity College in Hartford, CT. In Spring 2023 I earned a PhD in Environmental Chemistry focusing on marine biogeochemistry under Dr. Mark Teece at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF). I hold a BS in chemistry and a BS in environmental science from Northern Arizona University.

As a first generation college student I know the struggle to belong in the classroom and not having the confidence to raise my hand. Through teaching at Trinity College, SUNY ESF, and Onondaga Community College I work to encourage students to ask silly questions. Whether a student is struggling to understand or wants to go deeper into the material, there is always a place for questions in my classroom or office.

I study the biogeochemistry of sediment in coastal systems, primarily focusing on the Florida Keys Reef Tract. I use lipid biomarkers, along with stable isotope chemistry to track the origin of settling particles and surface sediment in reefs and another coastal ecosystems. In the future I am interested in building on my knowledge of lipids and stable isotopes to study coastal systems and the deep sea.

In my free time I enjoy exploring with my dog Flynn, reading, fishing, diving, cross stitching and drinking tea. Flynn is working on getting certified as a therapy dog after getting certified as a canine good citizen.

# Research
I study the interaction of sediment between coastal ecosystems, primarily focuses on the coral reefs of the Florida Keys Reef Tract. Using lipid composition and compound specific isotope analysis I track the biogeochemical cycling of particulate matter. 

As an undergraduate at Northern Arizona University I studied unregulated water sources on the Navajo Nation. I have since transitioned to another oligotrophic system: coral reefs. I have also worked at Mote Marine Laboratories aiding in a project looking at the interactions between sargassum and staghorn coral under the effects of ocean acidification.

### A dynamic energy budget for coral- _Symbiodinium_ symbiosis with particulate matter input
Stony coral are known to ingest particulate matter and assimilate carbon and nitrogen. I put together a dynamic energy budget for coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis which takes particulate matter into account as a nutrient source and the influence of particulate matter reducing light availability.

### Stony coral tissue loss disease does not alter lipid sedimentary signature
Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has been ravaging the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary since 2014. It has recently been shown that sediment is a vector for the transmission of the disease. However, lipids do not appear to alter the lipid geochemistry of the surrounding surface sediment.

### Cycling of organic matter and trace metals in nearshore coastal ecosystem sediments
Cycling of organic matter and trace metals in nearshore coastal ecosystem sediments
While the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorous between ecosystems has been extensively studied, there has been little done to understand the transport of lipids and trace metals between ecosystems. I am using GC-MS and ICP-MS to quantify lipid and trace metal concentrations in surface sediment from coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and beaches.

### Zooplankton derived organic matter as a food source for benthic coral
Zooplankton are vital players in the biological pump of the open ocean. However, it was previously thought that the water column on coral reefs was too shallow for zooplankton fecal pellets to play a major role. Our results indicate zooplankton as the primary driver of settling particles in the Upper Florida Keys.

### Sargassum, staghorn coral, and ocean acidification
This study was focused on understanding the effects of sargassum algae blooms on staghorn coral growth and chlorophyll fluorescence in future ocean acidification scenarios.

### Trace metal quantification of unregulated water sources on the Navajo Nation
The Navajo Nation faced decades of uranium mining with little to no safety or environmental precautions. Unregulated water sources (e.g. livestock tanks or family wells) are contaminated with heavy metals and negatively affect the health of the surrounding communities.
